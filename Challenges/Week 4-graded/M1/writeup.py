    The fundamental request is the register one. We aim to register a user as an admin.
    In orther to do so I exploited the fact that the server has a certain syntax for storing the token so that,
    when decryptying it will be parsed as desired.
    The principal part was::
        - we should be able to inject the role=admin field in the username so that it is before 
            the one added by the server
    With this two conditions, we can be sure that role=admin is parsed berfore role=user and then we are registered as admin.
    After we are registered as admins we can login and change the settings, and get our coffee!
